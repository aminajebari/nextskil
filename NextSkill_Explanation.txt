Explanation Document for NextSkill Project

1.  Overview This document explains the current structure, progress, and
    limitations of the NextSkill platform so you can review the work
    completed so far.

2.  Language Courses

-   The platform currently includes only English as an available
    language course on the dashboard.
-   The English course is not yet fully completed.
-   A separate “languages” folder exists inside the NextSkill directory.
    It is not yet connected to the main codebase, but the content inside
